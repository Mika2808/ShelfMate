# ShelfMate

## Project Overview

ShelfMate is a Book Discovery App built with **Flutter** for mobile experience. It is designed for book lovers to organize their personal library, discover new books, track reading progress, and interact with a vibrant community through reviews and ratings.

The backend is powered by **Node.js**, originally developed as part of a separate Book Review App project, and connected to this Flutter frontend.

## Core Features

- **User Authentication:** Register, login, and logout securely.
- **Book Search:** Search books by title, author, or category with dynamic results.
- **Personal To-Read List:** Manage a personalized list of books to read next.
- **Book Roulette:** Discover random book suggestions in a Tinder-style interfaceâ€”right button to add books to your to-read list, left one to skip.
- **Nearby Bookstores:** Find bookstores close to your current location with integrated geolocation support.
- **Reviews & Ratings:** Users can leave reviews and ratings for books, as well as read comments from other readers to make informed choices.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Flutter (tested on Android devices connected to a computer)
